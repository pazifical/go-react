# Go-React-Full-Stack 
A testbed for a minimal-dependency full stack approach without a frontend build step.

## Why no build step?
The majority of work in my projects is put into the backend and the database. Additionally Javascript and CSS have become very capable on its own. A build step seems overkill and adds too much complexity.
